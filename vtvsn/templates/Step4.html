Wait for the machine to process your ballot. Once<br> this is done, a poll clerk will mark your finger with indelible ink and will give<br> you your voting receipt to review.<br><br>Check your voting receipt to see if it correctly reflects who you voted for.<br><br>If the receipt does not match who you voted for, bring it to the BEI to register<br> your complaint. This will then be put on record.<br><br>If the receipt matches who you voted for, drop it in the voting receipt box once<br> done. Voters are not allowed to leave precincts with their voting receipt.<br> The Comelec says this is to <a href="{%url 'Step4II/'%}">protect the secrecy of the ballot</a> and deter vote <br>buying.</em>
