Members of the <br>EB who will be assisting these voters must also have completed sensitivity<br> training offered by the National Council on Disability Affairs and the<br> Commission on Human Rights.<br><br>There should be sign language interpreters or lists of candidates translated<br> into Braille in polling centers where voters with visual, speech, and hearing impairments are registered.<br><br>These measures are what RA 10366 and <a href="https://comelec.gov.ph/php-tpls-attachments/2016NLE/Resolutions/com_res_10108.pdf">Comelec Resolution No. 10484</a> seek<br> to provide PWDs, seniors, and even pregnant women. But there is much room <br>for improvement. It is one of the solutions that Comelec established and as per <br>the Comelec resolution, APPs are supposed to cater to PWDs, senior citizens, <br>and heavily pregnant women who struggles to vote.</em></p></div>
